# Project Overview
This project explores the use of the A* algorithm, an artificial intelligence technique previously unfamiliar to us. A* is designed to find the shortest path from a starting point to a destination. This project builds on the various AI implementations we have studied and allows us to further enhance our understanding of AI techniques.

## Project Structure
- src/: Contains all source code, organized into packages and classes.
- compilation.sh: A shell script to compile and run the program.
